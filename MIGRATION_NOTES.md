# Migration from Prisma + Clerk to Supabase

## What Has Been Completed

### 1. Database Schema
- ✅ Created complete Supabase schema with all tables
- ✅ Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables
- ✅ Created indexes for performance optimization
- ✅ Implemented role-based access control

### 2. Authentication
- ✅ Replaced Clerk with Supabase Auth
- ✅ Created authentication context and hooks
- ✅ Built sign-in page
- ✅ Updated middleware for Supabase session management
- ✅ Implemented role-based route protection

### 3. Server Actions
- ✅ Migrated all CRUD operations to Supabase:
  - createSubject, updateSubject, deleteSubject
  - createClass, updateClass, deleteClass
  - createTeacher, updateTeacher, deleteTeacher
  - createStudent, updateStudent, deleteStudent
  - createExam, updateExam, deleteExam

### 4. Components
- ✅ Updated Navbar to use Supabase auth
- ✅ Replaced Clerk UserButton with custom logout button
- ✅ Created ImageUpload component to replace next-cloudinary
- ✅ Updated StudentForm and TeacherForm
- ✅ Added AuthProvider to root layout

### 5. Dependencies
- ✅ Installed @supabase/supabase-js and @supabase/ssr
- ✅ Removed @clerk/nextjs and @clerk/elements
- ✅ Removed @prisma/client and prisma
- ✅ Removed next-cloudinary

### 6. Configuration
- ✅ Created Supabase client files (client.ts, server.ts, middleware.ts)
- ✅ Created TypeScript types for all database tables
- ✅ Created storage utilities for image uploads
- ✅ Environment variables are already configured

## What Needs To Be Done

### 1. Page Components
The following page components still have commented-out Prisma code and need to be refactored:

**List Pages** (all in `src/app/(dashboard)/list/`):
- announcements/page.tsx
- assignments/page.tsx
- classes/page.tsx
- events/page.tsx
- exams/page.tsx
- lessons/page.tsx
- parents/page.tsx
- results/page.tsx
- students/page.tsx
- subjects/page.tsx
- teachers/page.tsx

**Dashboard Pages**:
- admin/page.tsx
- student/page.tsx
- teacher/page.tsx
- parent/page.tsx

**Detail Pages**:
- students/[id]/page.tsx
- teachers/[id]/page.tsx

### 2. Data Fetching
Each page needs to replace Prisma queries with Supabase queries. Example pattern:

```typescript
// Old Prisma way:
const students = await prisma.student.findMany({
  where: { classId: 1 },
  include: { class: true }
});

// New Supabase way:
const supabase = await createClient();
const { data: students } = await supabase
  .from('students')
  .select('*, classes(*)')
  .eq('class_id', 1);
```

### 3. Type Definitions
Replace Prisma-generated types with Supabase types from `src/lib/supabase/types.ts`

### 4. Supabase Storage Setup
Storage buckets need to be created manually in Supabase dashboard:
1. Go to Supabase project → Storage
2. Create a bucket named "avatars" with public access
3. Set up RLS policies for the bucket

### 5. User Creation Flow
The current user creation in actions uses `supabase.auth.signUp()` which creates users with temporary passwords. Consider implementing:
- Email verification flow
- Password reset functionality
- Admin panel for user management

### 6. Image Upload Implementation
The ImageUpload component currently just handles file selection. To fully implement:
1. Create Supabase storage bucket
2. Update form submissions to upload images to Supabase Storage
3. Update image URLs throughout the app

### 7. Real-time Features
Supabase supports real-time subscriptions. Consider adding:
- Live updates for announcements
- Real-time attendance tracking
- Live notifications for events

## Migration Steps for Remaining Pages

For each page component, follow these steps:

1. **Import Supabase client:**
```typescript
import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server';
```

2. **Replace auth check:**
```typescript
// Old:
const { userId, sessionClaims } = auth();
const role = sessionClaims?.metadata?.role;

// New:
const supabase = await createClient();
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
const role = user?.user_metadata?.role;
```

3. **Replace data queries:**
Use Supabase's query builder instead of Prisma. Reference the types in `src/lib/supabase/types.ts`.

4. **Update type definitions:**
Replace Prisma types with Supabase types or custom types that match your schema.

## Database Connection

The Supabase database is already connected and configured with:
- URL: Available in `.env` as `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- Anon Key: Available in `.env` as `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying, test:
- [ ] User sign-in with different roles (admin, teacher, student, parent)
- [ ] Create, update, and delete operations for all entities
- [ ] Role-based access control (users can only access their allowed routes)
- [ ] Form submissions with image uploads
- [ ] Search and filtering on list pages
- [ ] Pagination on list pages
- [ ] Detail pages for students and teachers

## Known Issues

1. **Page Components:** Most list and dashboard pages are currently commented out and need Supabase implementation
2. **Image Upload:** File upload to Supabase Storage is not yet implemented
3. **Email Verification:** Supabase auth users are created without email verification
4. **Type Safety:** Some components may have type errors until all Prisma types are replaced
